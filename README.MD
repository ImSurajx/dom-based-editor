## 🧩 DOM-Based Visual Editor (Figma-Style)

This project is a browser-based visual editor inspired by tools like Figma.  
It allows users to create, select, move, and manage simple UI elements directly on a canvas using mouse interactions.  
The editor is built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (DOM-based), focusing on core editor mechanics.
